Why my rankings are the way they are
=====
First off, let us talk about fruits.
Now, before you guys get on my back about leaving out mangoes or whatnot, let me just put out a disclaimer that these are my favorite fruits when they're at their PEAK. So out of all of the fruits at their peak, I have blackberries at their peak above any other fruit at their peak. Now the thing about blackberries is that when they're NOT at their peak, they can sometimes be bitter, or sour, or sometimes downright bland. But at their prime, blackberries are just slightly firm, amazingly sweet, have a saisfying (in my opinion) crunch from the seeds, and leave me wanting more. Same goes for raspberries. They can sometimes be too soft and mushy, or too sour, but like blackberries, the best raspberries are simply the best of the fruits. 

If you know me personally, my ranking of oranges as number three should come to you as no surprise. This summer, at CMU Precollege, I ate 42 oranges in a single day, so much that it earned me the nickname of "Orange Guy." Didn't eat lunch and was starving? Look no further than Orange Guy to provide you with some citrusy sustenance. Entered a room with a citrus, fresh, scent? Orange Guy's to blame. But in all seriousness, oranges in their prime are forces to be reckoned with, especially the 蜜橘 I be finding at the local H-Mart. My mom could buy 5, or 10, or 20 - no matter - and all would be finished within an hour of returning home. I love oranges. No more to be said here.

As for watermelon, I think this is a universally agreed upon fruit, but I still have some words to say. When I look for a watermelon, I look for BIG, BLACK, SEEDS. None of the small dinky seeds, or the seedless varieties fly by. As for texture, I look for a juicy, but not soft melon - I believe the word in chinese is 沙沙 (but sandy isn't quite how I'd describe it). Sometimes when we have a quarter of a watermelon left at home, we won't even bother cutting them - we'll just pull out spoons and start digging in directly. And drink up the watermelon juice from the rind-bowl, after.

Seedless grapes is a controversial pick, according to my family. My mom really, really, loves the peony grapes that you need to deskin and watch out for seeds. Sure, I think they're pretty good. But worth the hassle? Not really. The skin is bitter, and the seeds hurt my mouth. Now, seedless grapes, on the other hand, aren't as sweet, but the taste is still on par. Also, there's no need to deskin or whatnot, and freezing them makes a perfect summer-time treat. Peony grapes, titan napes, superhero capes, SEEDLESS GRAPES IN 5.
Now, when I introduced my Honorable Mentions to my friends, they had their objections. Apparently, they like their peaches soft. Well, this is my list so hard peaches are the only peaches you'll find on this list.

For my favorite Pokémon regions, be aware that most of it IS nostalgia bias. My first ever Pokémon game was Pokémon Ruby, then Emerald, and then Alpha Sapphire. And then I played both Pokémon Silver and Heart Gold. That should explain the first two. 

Now, Sinnoh is number 3 on this list for 2 reasons: The Pokémon introduced in Sinnoh was peak. Absolute cinema. I'd argue that Unova had slightly better Pokémon, but hold your horses. Reason number 2 on why Sinnoh is 2nd, is because it's the first region to have a REAL snow area. No, Mt. Silver's peak doesn't count, and Kanto's Seafoam Islands don't have **snow**. Winter's my favorite season. Ice-type is my favorite type. Go figure. 

Unova and Kalos are tied up for 4th. Unova has peak Pokémon design, and Kalos has a phenomenal soundtrack, and I feel like it's region design and lore is unparalleled (though Hoenn IS surprisingly lore deep). Alola is next. It's island theme was definitely novel, and I loved the Ultra Beasts. However, the other regions are simply better. In my definitely non-biased opinion, of course. 

The last two regions are Galar and Paldea. Galar was alright. I liked it. It wasn't bad. However, Paldea's Pokémon design is definitely worse, and I'm not familiar enough with the region to give it an accurate ranking. It's in last for those reasons (sure, it's unfair, but who cares?)

If we're ranking the regions based on their music, however, the list changes slightly. This time, Hoenn and Johto are tied for 1st. If I REALLY REALLY had to choose one between the two, I'd choose Hoenn simply because I played it before I played a Johto game. Hoenn has Soaring Illusions (the GOAT of Pokémon Music), Littleroot Town (which arguably sounds even better in Gen III than in Gen VI), Route 104, Zinnia's Theme, and a Surf Theme that absolutely SLAPS. These are just some examples, by the way. The entire town and route category in Hoenn is SSS tier. Meanwhile, Johto has Ecruteak City, New Bark Town, Azalea Town, the National Park Theme, and a Surf Theme that SLAPS even MORE. It's entire soundtrack, aside from the cave themes, is SSS+ tier. In fact, in 11th grade, while I was taking my C++ Final Exam at my dual enrollment class at De Anza College, I was listening to the HGSS Soundtrack (yes, we were permitted to listen to music). Fact: I was headbanging so hard the professor had to come over and tap my shoulder to make sure I wasn't having a seizure. 

Kalos is 2nd (technically 3rd, after both Hoenn and Johto). Why? Because of Snowbelle City's theme alone. In all seriousness, the entire Kalos lineup is elite. Absolutely amazing. Superb. And really really unique (well, not exactly unique, but really good use of) instrumentation and orchestration. It totally maximized the sound opportunites the new console hardware offered, and ran away with the results.

Sinnoh's Pokémon League theme is super uniqe. It's calm, slightly wistful, and tranquill, unlike the really ferocious and aggressive Pokémon League themes of other games. In my opinion, this more "mature" theme, if you will, fits perfectly, especially in the context of the game narrative. Sinnoh's plot is one of the most extreme, and the amount of hardship the player needs to go through just to arrive at the Pokémon League is what makes Sinnoh's peaceful, almost sad, League theme so fitting and perfect. And although Cynthia's theme is absolutely wiped by Zinnia (from Hoenn)'s theme, it's still a track that'll live on, through the collective trauma of an entire generation. 

Unova is also awesome. Its more contemporary music style also makes perfect sense given the region's inspiration of New York. I just love everything else more. Same goes for Alola, Galar, and Paldea. I feel personally as if somewhere down the line, the music of the later generations lost a bit of what made it "Pokémon" music.

For my Pokémon list, there is no real reasoning per se. Out of all my rankings, Favorite Pokémon is the most subjective. I love Venipede because it's cute. I love Slowpoke because it's cute. I love Dragonair because it's cute. I love Wailmer because it's cute. I love Shellder because it's cute. 

I love ranking things. It's always super tough, trying to find the perfect place for every option, putting one above another. Yet it's super satisfying, in an inexplicable way. Anyways, these are my rankings that I deemed important enough to spend 5 hours defending. Thank you.
